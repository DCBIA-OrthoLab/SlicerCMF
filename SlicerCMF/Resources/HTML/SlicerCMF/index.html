<h2>SlicerCMF modules:</h2>

<h3><a href="#ShapePopulationViewer">ShapePopulationViewer</a></h3>
<p>
    This module allows to interact with multiple 3D surfaces at the same time. It supports
    visualization and comparison of 3D surfaces by displaying the associated pointwise
    data (scalar or vector maps) via customizable colormaps.
</p>

<h3><a href="#ShapeVariationAnalyzer">ShapeVariationAnalyzer</a></h3>
<p>
    This module allows the classification of 3D models, according to their morphological
    variation. This tool is based on a deep learning neural network. The module is
    composed of multiple panels to perform the different steps of the process: create the
    classification groups, compute their average shapes, train the classifier and classify
    shapes.
</p>

<h3><a href="#AnglePlanes">Angle Planes</a></h3>
<p>
    This module is used to calculate the angle between two planes. The user selects
    already loaded planes or they can define a plane by using three landmarks.
</p>

<h3><a href="#BoneTexture">Bone Texture</a></h3>
<p>
    This module allows to interact with multiple 3D surfaces at the same time. It supports
    visualization and comparison of 3D surfaces by displaying the associated pointwise
    data (scalar or vector maps) via customizable colormaps.
</p>

<h3><a href="#SurfaceRegistration">Surface Registration</a></h3>
<p>
    This module performs region based registration.
</p>

<h3><a href="#EasyClip">EasyClip</a></h3>
<p>
    This module is used to clip and close one or
    several models according to a predetermined plane. Planes can be saved and reused.
</p>

<h3><a href="#MeshStatistics">MeshStatistics</a></h3>
<p>
    This module computes descriptive statistics (min, max, avg, std, 5th per, 15th per,
    15th per, 75th per, 85th per and 99th per) on data fields of a model or models. The
    statistics can be computed over predefined regions (selected with <a
        href="#PickAndPaint">PickAndPaint</a>) or the entire model.
</p>

<h3><a href="#MeshToLabelMap">Mesh to Label Map</a></h3>
<p>
    This module can converts a model into a binary segmentation image volume.
</p>

<h3><a href="#ModelToModelDistance">Model to Model Distance</a></h3>
<p>
    This module computes a point by point distance between two models.
</p>

<h3><a href="#PickAndPaint">Pick and Paint</a></h3>
<p>
    This module selects a region of interest (ROI) in a model or models. The user selects
    a landmark and a number of vertices to define the size of the ROI, and this
    information gets propagated to the rest of the models in case of having multiple ones.
</p>

<h3><a href="#Q3DC">Q3DC</a></h3>
<p>
    This module allows to perform head measurements used in craniofacial surgery (called
    Quantitative 3D Cephalometrics). Using placed fiducials, the module allows users to
    compute 2D angles: Yaw, Pitch and Roll; and decompose the 3D distance into the three
    different components: R-L , A-P and S-I. It is possible to compute the middle point
    between two fiducials and export the values.
</p>

<h3><a href="#SurfaceRegistration">Surface Registration</a></h3>
<p>
    This module allows the user to compute and apply transformations (registration)
    between two 3D models (VTK file). The registration can be computed using the entire
    mesh of both models (Surface Registration), just a region of interest (ROI
    Registration) on each model, or two fiducial lists which can be projected on the
    meshes (Fiducial Registration).
</p>

<h3><a href="#NonGrowing">Image Registration (NonGrowing)</a></h3>
<p>
    This module allows the user to compute and apply transformations (registration)
    between two 3D volumes. The registration can use a one-label segmentation image to
    define a region of interest on each model.
</p>

<h3><a href="#Growing">Image Registration (Growing)</a></h3>
<p>
    This module provides additional voxel-based registration options in addition to the
    functionality provided by the <a href="#NonGrowing">NonGrowing</a> module.
</p>
